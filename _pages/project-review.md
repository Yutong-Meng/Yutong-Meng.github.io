  Project review for HIST 4261/5261: Working With Data
---

The website I chose is https://jerseylen.github.io/incarceration-in-real-numbers/

It is a website that visualizes data about incarceration in the United States. The site author (GitHub username "jerseylen") uses a variety of interactive ICONS, such as bar charts, line charts, and area charts, to show the scale of incarceration in the United States, trends, and differences across demographic groups and geographies. Through this website, the author hopes to show some of the problems of the U.S. incarceration system, such as the excessive size of the incarceration system, racial inequality and regional differences, and urge readers to pay more attention to and think about criminal justice reform and social justice.

# A Interactive Way to Visualizing Incarceration Data

The site breaks away from the boring presentation of traditional tables and static charts and makes the data "come alive". Each little icon on the page represents the number of people incarcerated. As the page scrolls, the number of little ICONS gradually increases, and readers can intuitively see how many 2.3million there are. The interactive site, which includes animation, uses cartoon graphics, also expands the site's audience and can be easily read by everyone from younger readers to professional researchers. At the same time, it is also very suitable as a public awareness site for prison issues.

<div align="center">
  <video style="max-width:80%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;" controls>
    <source src="/assets/img/1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video>
</div>

And the site uses an interactive way to dynamically display text and tables. As you scroll through the web, data and text will gradually expand, making people more eager to explore. This way the reader will not be bored or the data will be too cluttered.

<div align="center">
  <video style="max-width:80%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;" controls>
    <source src="/assets/img/2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video>
</div>

In this chart, for example, readers can switch between different reasons for incarceration and immediately see how the numbers change. Like, when you choose the factor "Release all non-violent drug offenders", the number of incarcerated will decline rapidly; At the same time, you can see which factors can be checked to make the incarceration rate in the United States lower than in other countries. This makes it easy to understand at a glance the factors behind mass incarceration.

# Covering Diverse Jurisdictions

The site's data includes multiple jurisdictions, such as federal prisons, juvenile detention centers, and immigration detention facilities. Compared to the traditional approach of focusing only on federal or state prisons, this broad data coverage avoids some of the biases that can arise from incomplete data collection. Moreover, this work can compare the differences between different types of facilities and help to find the advantages and problems of each.


# Transparency and Clear Methodology

By clicking on the notes following the text, we can access the site's GitHub repository, where we can find detailed data sources and methodology explanations. The authors explain in detail which research institutions or official reports the data came from, and explain the sampling process and processing of the raw data.

</div>

At the same time, the authors explain uncertain data, such as the lack of transparency in official reports, the number of incarcerated people in China is difficult to verify and can only be estimated or referred to third-party statistics. This clarification can help researchers and readers understand possible errors in the study and avoid any misunderstanding. But at the same time, because some numbers rely on estimates, there may be some error, which is a weekness for the site.

# Reliance on Secondhand Data

As can be seen from the Github Repository explanation, the authors rely on secondary sources such as the Prison Policy Initiative (PPI) and Wikipedia for much of their data. This means that data has already been filtered, processed, and interpreted. This cooked data can introduce some biases, thereâ€™s always a chance that certain details were emphasized or omitted based on how the sources chose to present them.

# Masking Significant Regional Variations

Another potential bias comes from the fact that the data is too broad - it doesn't break down incarceration rates at the state or city level. Since different states have different sentencing policies, law enforcement practices, and socioeconomic conditions, if only national data is provided, Regional differences are likely to be masked by these national averages. For example, in some states with stricter enforcement (Florida), minor offenses are more likely to result in incarceration; In some states that have implemented bail reforms (such as New York), low-income individuals may be more likely to be released. By looking only at the previously seen data, readers may get the misleading impression that incarceration trends are evenly distributed across the United States, when in fact there are huge differences between regions.
